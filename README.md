Weather forecast
==================

This code includes a working weather forecast webpage (`weatherreport.html`) with a minimum recommended resolution of 320x240. The webpage can easily be embedded into another webpage using an `iframe`.

An example on how to implement this in your website:

    <iframe src=weatherreport.html width=320px height=240px style="border:none;">
    
The weather forecast can easily scale up to big resolutions and still looks good when it would for example get resized. If wanted you can also change certain variables to change the amount of clouds rendered, etc.
